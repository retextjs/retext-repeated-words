[**retext**][retext] plugin to check for ~~`for`~~ repeated words.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-repeated-words
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.txt`:

```txt
Well, it it doesn’t have to to be. Like a fish in the
the sea.
```

…and our script, `example.js`, looks like this:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var english = require('retext-english')
var stringify = require('retext-stringify')
var repeated = require('retext-repeated-words')

unified()
  .use(english)
  .use(repeated)
  .use(stringify)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.txt'), function(err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```txt
example.txt
   1:7-1:12  warning  Expected `it` once, not twice   retext-repeated-words  retext-repeated-words
  1:26-1:31  warning  Expected `to` once, not twice   retext-repeated-words  retext-repeated-words
   1:51-2:4  warning  Expected `the` once, not twice  retext-repeated-words  retext-repeated-words

⚠ 3 warnings
```
